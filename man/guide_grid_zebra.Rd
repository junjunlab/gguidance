\title{Zebra grid guide}
\usage{
guide_grid_zebra(
  along = "x",
  just = 0.5,
  at = "major",
  on_top = FALSE,
  evenodd = "odd"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{along}{A \code{character(1)}, one of \code{"x"} or \code{"y"} indicating along which
direction the stripes should occur.}

\item{just}{A \code{numeric(1)} between 0 and 1, setting the justification of the
stripes relative to the major ticks.}

\item{at}{A \code{character(1)}, one of \code{"major"} or \code{"minor"} indicating what
breaks to consider for making stripes. Note that \code{"minor"} automatically
includes the major breaks.}

\item{on_top}{A \code{logical(1)}. If \code{TRUE}, stripes are drawn on top of the
grid lines of the orthogonal direction. The default is \code{FALSE}, in which
case stripes are drawn underneath those grid lines.}

\item{evenodd}{A \code{character(1)}, one of \code{"even"} or \code{"odd"} indicating which
breaks to take for stripes.}
}
\value{
A \verb{<Guide>} ggproto object that can be given to \code{coord_guided()}.
}
\description{
This grid guide draws alternating stripes along one of the axes, resembling
a zebra crossing (or indeed, the animal itself).
}
\examples{
# A standard plot
p <- ggplot(economics, aes(date, unemploy)) +
  geom_line()

# By default, stripes are centered at major breaks
p + coord_guided("grid_zebra")

# To set stripes in between breaks, use the `just` argument
p + coord_guided(guide_grid_zebra(just = 0))

# Alternatively, also use minor breaks
p + coord_guided(guide_grid_zebra(at = "minor", just = 1))

# Stripe colour is controlled by the major panel grid
p + coord_guided("grid_zebra") +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(colour = "grey80"))
