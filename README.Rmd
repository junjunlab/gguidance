The goal of gguidance is to provide additional guides to the ggplot2 ecosystem. Guides are re-implemented within the ggproto system to make use of the flexible extension framework.

Please note that this repo is still being worked on and, while probably usable, isn't finished.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gguidance from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("teunbrand/gguidance")
```

## Examples

Here is a simple example of how to use an axis guide and a colour bar guide.

```{r example}
library(gguidance)

ggplot(msleep, aes(bodywt, sleep_total)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = sleep_rem)) +
  scale_colour_viridis_c(guide = "colourbar_cap") +
  scale_x_log10(guide = "axis_log")
```

Demonstrating a cross legend and axis subtitles.

```{r example2}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = paste(cyl, year))) +
  guides(colour = "legend_cross",
         x = guide_axis_ext(subtitle = "litres"),
         y = guide_axis_ext(subtitle = "miles per gallon"))
```

## Progress

So far, the following has been implemented:

* **Axis guides**
   * `guide_axis_vanilla()`: A re-implementation of `guide_axis()`.
   * `guide_axis_ext()`: Extended options for axes.
   * `guide_axis_minor()`: Axes with minor ticks.
   * `guide_axis_trunc()`: Axes with truncated axis lines.
   * `guide_axis_log()`: Axes with log10-based tickmarks.
* **Legend guides**
   * `guide_legend_vanilla()`: A re-implementation of `guide_legend()`.
   * `guide_legend_cross()`: Combining two sets of labels in one legend.
* **Colour bar guides**
   * `guide_colourbar_vanilla()`: A re-implementation of `guide_colourbar()`.
   * `guide_colourbar_cap()`: With cap decorations at the ends.
* **Coordinate guides** (a new feature in `coord_guided()`)
   * `guide_grid_vanilla()`: A re-implementation of default panel grids.
   * `guide_grid_zebra()`: Alternating stripes at/between breaks.
   * `guide_grid_swap()`: Displaying major grid as minor and minor grid as
        major. Convenient for separating places in discrete scales.

## Notes

A medium-term goal is to move and refactor guides from the {ggh4x} package to {gguidance}. A longer-term goal is to make this package a hub for additional axes, legends and other guides.
